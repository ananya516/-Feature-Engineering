        "\n",
        "A parameter is a value that describes a characteristic of a population (e.g., population mean or standard deviation).\n",
        "It is usually fixed and unknown, unlike statistics which are derived from samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is Correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.\n",
        "It ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 meaning no correlation.\n",
